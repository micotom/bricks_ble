# bricks_ble

Example project to remote control motors and sensors of a big company selling clippable blocks.
Codecs are externalised into own Kotlin/Java module so can be used independent from the Android example project.

As of now, the lib module covers the most basic operations but can be easily extended to full spec
as documented via the official [Lego BLE docs](https://lego.github.io/lego-ble-wireless-protocol-docs/index.html).
